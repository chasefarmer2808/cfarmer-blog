I am a soon-to-be father, husband, software engineer, tech lead, and overall tech enthusiast.  My current career path is full-stack web development.  Building software applications and services fuels my passion for making positive impacts on people's lives through technology.  I never stop learning, and am always keeping up with tech trends to stay ahead of the industry.  

I am adept in Kotlin, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, and C#, but am currently learning Rust and Go.  I believe in learning fundamental principles of software architecture and design as opposed to being tied to any one stack.  However, I am most comfortable with React for client-side and Micronaught for server-side.  I am excited to learn more about newer concepts that bridge the gap between front-end and back-end like server-side components and server-side rendering.  I also have experience in fundamental DevOps principles such as Infrastructure as Code with Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines for development lifecycle automation.  My cloud provider of choice is Azure.

I'm always open to chat with other tech enthusiasts.  I help organize a tech meetup called Code and Coffee, and help organize a DevOps conference called DevOps Days.  Feel free to connect with me through these events on on LinkedIn.

Cheers!

# Goals for 2024

## 1. Start a family

My wife and are are having a little baby girl in April and we couldn't be more excited!  At the time of writing this, we feel as prepared as can be to become parents.  We've taken classes on pregnancy and infant care, read books on the psychology of parenting, and talked about the type of parents that we want to be.  Of course, things will happen that we didn't anticipate.  Because of this, the ability to adapt and be flexible will be key.

## 2. Become a more effective leader

Last year, I became a tech lead for an engineering team for the first time in my career.  It's been a great experience so far, as I enjoy working with people just as much as I love coding.  I've had some early wins and have already begun to establish strong, positive relationships with all of my team members.  This year, I want to create even more of an impact be focusing on true mentorship and leadership.  I want to be able to easily channel the energy of good engineers on the team, and guide those that are struggling.  I want to foster a safe working environment so team members feel open to discuss things with me.  I want everyone to feel motivated and appreciated.  I want to have clear and concise explainations for effective collaboration.
